## Strobogrammatic number
A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated upside down, such as 8, 101, 96. Here we consider 1 to be strobogrammatic.
I developed two codes using a **iterative** and **recursive** approach that takes an integer _n_ as input and returns all the strobogrammatic numbers of length _n_ in a list.
$$\frac{a}{b}$$
